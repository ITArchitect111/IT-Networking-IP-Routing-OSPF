# IT-Networking-IP-Routing-OSPF

## Description
This project demonstrates a complete network topology setup using:
- **2 Router**
- **2 Switches**
- **Multiple PCs**

The configuration includes **Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)**, **VLANs**, and **Open Shortest Path First (OSPF)**. Designed and simulated using **Cisco Packet Tracer**, this setup is ideal for learning DHCP addressing, VLAN Management and IP Routing.

---

## Project Objectives
- Configure DHCP for dynamic IP assignment to all devices.
- Create and assign VLANs for separating 2 different Networks.
- Enable Dyanmic IP routing using OSPF.
- Practice router and switch CLI configuration.

# IT Networking Source File/
- **IT Network 2 (IP Routing OSPF).pkt**
  
# README.md

## Tools Used
- **Cisco Packet Tracer** – for simulation and design
- **Text Editor** – for writing and reviewing CLI configs

---

## How to Use
1. Open the `IT Network 2 (IP Routing OSPF).pkt` file using **Cisco Packet Tracer**.
2. Check Network devices if they have DHCP, VLANs, and the OSPF neighbor exist.
3. Try to ping the IP address of PC in same VLANs and then try to ping the IP address in different VLANs.
